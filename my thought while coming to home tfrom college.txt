Whenever I start my return journey from college to home,I think of  what I added to myself or what effect I made in the life of people around me and while thinking this I catch the bus to start my 30 km of journey to home in which I see infinite number of  scenes but the most noticeable and thoughtful is the scene of a temple,outside of which 2-3 beggars are begging money from the people for their survival,at this moment many  questions,thoughts and solutions arise in me........

This raises a question in my mind that what are  the so called DM's and SDM's are doing,is the civil administration which comes in big convoy's is failed, who will see to this problem,who will give them a opportunity to connect to the main stream and if they can't give this much then atleast they should provide them a way to earn their living respectfully as invisaged in the article 21 i.e. rigth to live with human dignity.

so as my bus passes with several jerks,many solutions comes up in my mind and one of them is that the civil administration with the help of local NGO'S can give them training to sew the flowers together by which they can make garlands after which they can also start a small shop in which they can sell the items used in temples. 

And after thinking this i ask question to myself that why I should not be that person to take the first initiative to pratically implement this idea on ground but soon the bus arrives to that road which takes me to the home and then my first question again clicked to my mind that what I did today to produce some sort of betterment in me or in my surrounding........
