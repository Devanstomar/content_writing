"You can't put a limit on anything.The more you dream the further you get"-Michael phelps

The world athletics day was firstly introduced by the then IAAF president Primo Nebiolo in 1996.
International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) is the apex governing body for the sport of athletics.

On this day every year the IAAF organizes diverse sports event in school and colleges and other institutions,to promote the participation of youth in sports especially athletics.
World athletics day 2022 theme is"securing a Sustainable and peaceful future for all: The contribution of sport".

In the current situation when so much health related problems are there it is indeed the need of an hour for the people to inculcate sports in their life.

At last we can learn a lot from the life of a athlete which runs like a sine graph having several ups and downs but one thing always remain constant i.e. hardwork.

Wishing you all a inspiring international athletics day!!
