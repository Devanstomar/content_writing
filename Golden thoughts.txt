AS the board results are announced so one thought came up to my mind which i want to share with you all so  as usual when results comes out then the  society or the students themselves makes divisions in terms of percentages which makes the students elated or dejected but in ground reality these percentages are just a number which in this century and has no credibility to decide your future what this era is seeing is the value you added in yourself and the value you will add in your surroundings in terms of technical ,communication ,physical ,personality wise or anything which this world requires.

So whatever percentage you have scored be happy as finally it was you who gave the all the efforts,but don't be too sad or too joyful as the battle has just started.

Thank you and keep hustling for not being the same you are yesterday.jai hind!!
