"Real leaders must be ready to sacrifice all for the freedom of their people"
                            -Nelson Mandela

On 18 July every year, we invite you to mark Nelson Mandela International Day by making a difference in your communities.
Nelson Mandela dedicated his whole life to the service of humanity â€” as a human rights lawyer, a prisoner of conscience, an international peacemaker and the first democratically elected president of a free South Africa.

The quote which is mentioned above is written by himself and it also truely defines his life as a person.He was a real leader as he sacrificed his 27 years of life in confinement for the betterment of humankind.

Its a day that stimulates our inner self to transpose the world for the better.It teaches us how to fight for a right cause in a virtuous way without loosing perseverance. 

On this day we all should take a pledge at  our quantum level that we will  start doing things which will ameliorate the pain of this world.
